# SPERO Stop-Rotor Aircraft Simulation Model

This repository provides the Simulink and Simscape implementation of the **SPERO** (Stop-rotor Propulsion for Efficient Rotary Operation) aircraft model. SPERO is a novel stop-rotor concept designed to combine the vertical takeoff and landing capabilities of helicopters with the efficient cruise performance of fixed-wing aircraft.

The model is intended to support academic research in the areas of hybrid aircraft dynamics, control system design, and rotor transition analysis.
