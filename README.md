## Overview
This repository provides the Simulink mode (via Simscape) of **SPERO** (Stopped Penta-Rotor). SPERO is a novel stop-rotor configuration that uses a flippig wing, an active center of pressure, a quadcopter architecture, and wing latch mechanism to achieve stable forward and reverse transition. The provided model can be used to develop novel control systems or adapted to test different mechanical configurations. 

## Features

## Dependencies
To run the simulation, the following MATLAB toolboxes are required:

- MATLAB R2023b or later
- Simulink
- Simscape
- Simscape Multibody
- Aerospace Blockset (optional, for advanced functionality)

## Model Overview

The SPERO simulation model includes the following core components:

- **Simulink** system-level model for overall aircraft behavior and control
- **Simscape Multibody** components for modeling mechanical dynamics, rotor stop/start, and actuator motion
- **Parametric configuration** to enable scalable mission scenarios (hover, transition, forward flight)

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/spero-stop-rotor-sim.git
   cd spero-stop-rotor-sim
